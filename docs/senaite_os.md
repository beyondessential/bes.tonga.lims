# Setup a minimal Debian server

## Introduction

For best performance, the installation of a minimal Debian server is
recommended. [Debian][debian] is a lightweight and thoroughly tested Linux
distribution, well-known for its stability, reliability and security, mostly
because of [Debian release life cycle][debian_releases] and
[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)][debian_lts].

This documentation assumes the Operating System of choice is
[Debian 11 (bullseye)][debian_11], that was initially
[released on August 2021][debian_11_press_release] and is
[officially supported by Debian Project until June 2026][debian_lts].

> **Warning**
> Commands from this recipe have to be run in the server, so the command
> prompt is omitted by default. ``me@local:~$`` will be used otherwise, to
> indicate the command has to be run from the user's local machine.

## Installation

The easiest way to install debian is to download the latest
[net installer iso][debian_net installer] and then burn it into a USB stick and
use it as the boot device of the target machine/host/VM. If you are using a
_debian-like_ system, follow the instructions on
[how to write a CD/DVD/BD image to a USB flash drive][faq_write_usb].
Otherwise, pick any of the available tools out there for different Operating
Systems that allow burning ISO files into USB sticks.

Reboot the target system on which you want to install Debian and go to its BIOS
settings and change boot medium from Hard disk to bootable media
(like USB / DVD) if not set as the first bootable media.

Once rebooted, the system will boot into the "Installation Menu" of Debian:

![Choose-Graphical-Install-Debian11][debian_install_menu]

Select "Graphical Install" from the options, and the installation will begin.

**It is strongly recommended not to install any of the Graphical Desktop
environments of choice**. The rendering of graphical interface consumes RAM and
CPU; in a production environment this usually means a waste of space and
resources. Since access to this server will always be done through a
[Secure Shell (SSH)][ssh] connection, the installation of a graphical user
interface is not necessary.

### Installation settings

Be sure to set the correct settings within the installation process in the
following screens:

- **_Setup users and passwords_**: Leave `root` user without password. System's
  initial user account will be `senaite`.

- **_Partition disks_**: Select "_Guided â€“ use entire disk and setup LVM_" and
  "_All files in one partition_". Installer will create a single LVM based
  partition automatically for whole disk.

- **_Software selection_**: **Leave all options unchecked except "_SSH server_"
  and "_standard system utilities_"**. We want a "minimal" debian server.

Please refer to the [Debian Installation Guide][debian_install_guide] for
detailed information about all installation options available.

## Update your Debian Installation

Login to the system as superuser (usually `root`) and make sure that your
``/etc/apt/sources.list`` contains the ``bullseye/updates`` repository (this
makes sure you always get the newest security updates), and that the
``contrib`` and ``non-free`` repositories are enabled as some required packages
are not in the main repository.

```shell
# nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

```ini
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main
```

Update the ``apt`` package database and install latest updates, if any:

```shell
# apt update
# apt upgrade
```

## Creation of senaite user

If either the system does not come with a ``senaite`` user with ``sudo``
privileges or you've created another user while installing the operating
system, login as the initial user or ``root`` and create a ``senaite`` user
with the following command:

```shell
# adduser --home /home/senaite --shell /bin/bash senaite
```

Check ``sudo`` command is installed or install it otherwise:

```shell
# apt update
# apt install sudo
```

> **Note**
> More information: [sudo command][sudo_command], [sudo manpage][sudo_manpage],
[adduser manpage][adduser_manpage]

## Add senaite user to sudoers

Login to the system as superuser (usually `root`) and add `senaite` user to the
group of `sudoers`:

```shell
# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/senaite
```

```ini
# User rules for SENAITE
senaite ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

## Set the timezone

Using the correct time zone is essential for system related tasks and
processes. For example, the cron daemon uses the system's time zone for
executing cron jobs. The time zone is also used for logs timestamps. Likewise,
SENAITE database may fail if the last modification date is in the future.

Before changing the time zone, you'll need to find out the long name of the
time zone you want to use. The time zone naming convention usually uses a
"Region/City" format. To view all available time zones, use the
[`timedatectl`][timedatectl] command:

```shell
$ timedatectl list-timezones
```

Once you identify which time zone is accurate to your location, run the
following command as root or sudo user:

```shell
$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Port_of_Spain
```

To verify the change, invoke the `timedatectl` command again:

```shell
$ timedatectl
               Local time: Wed 2023-08-23 03:52:30 AST
           Universal time: Wed 2023-08-23 07:52:30 UTC
                 RTC time: Wed 2023-08-23 07:52:31
                Time zone: America/Port_of_Spain (AST, -0400)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```

## Synchronize the System Clock

It is a good idea to synchronize the system clock with
an [NTP (network time protocol)][ntp] server over the Internet. Run the
following to ensure the system is alywas in sync.

```shell
# apt -y install ntp
```

## Install SSH OpenSSH server

The remote access to this server will be done through a
[Secure Shell (SSH)][ssh] connection, that provides a
[secure channel][secure_channel] over an unsecured network. While logged in as
`root` user, install [`openssh-server`][openssh-server] in your system, if not
yet installed, as follows:

```shell
# apt install openssh-server
```

Once installed, `sshd` (`OpenSSH Daemon`), that listens for connections from
clients, will start automatically. `sshd` process will also start at boot.

## Setup your public SSH key

Add **your public key** to the server's authorized keys. If you don't yet have
your pair of private/public SSH keys, **create one in your local machine** as
follows:

```shell
me@local:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

> **Note**
> More information: [ssh-keygen at Wikipedia][ssh_keygen_wikipedia]

Install your SSH key on the server as an authorized key by typing the following
command in your **local machine**:

```shell
me@local:~$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub senaite@host
```

where:

- `host`: the IP of the server we are setting up

> **Note**
> `id_rsa.pub` is the file name linux uses by default when creating your
> key pair. Change the file name if required. `host` is the host name or IP
> of the server we are configuring. More information:
> [`ssh-copy-id` manpage][ssh-copy-id]

You now will be able to access to your server without password. Type the
following command in your **local machine**:

```shell
me@local:~$ ssh senaite@host
Linux Debian-bullseye-64-minimal 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12) x86_64

```

## Secure SSH access

In order to properly secure the system, it is recommended to ensure your SSH
server is configured according to best practices. SSH configuration involves
modifying the `sshd_config` file, that can be found at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

```shell
# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

The recommended configuration is as follows:

- **`Port 3022`**: Port 22 is a well known SSH port and therefore a target for
  attacks. Port numbers below 1024 might have been officially reserved for some
  other protocol. Port number above 1024 is recommended.

- **`PermitRootLogin without-password`**: Allows the login as root, but only to
  users with an authorized key. Alternatively, use `PermiRootLogin no` to
  disable remote login with root permanently.

- **`PasswordAuthentication no`**: This makes it impossible to access the
  system without an authorized public key. User won't be prompted for password
  and server will deny access automatically.

- **`StrictModes yes`**: Specifies whether sshd should check file modes and
  ownership of the user's files and home directory before accepting login. This
  is normally desirable because novices sometimes accidentally leave their
  directory or files world-writable.

- **`PubkeyAuthentication yes`**: This setting disables password-based logins,
  so only public key based logins are allowed.

- **`AllowAgentForwarding no`**: If enabled, this setting allows the user that
  connects remotely to the server to use it's own local SSH keys (e.g. for
  downloading from a repository) instead of relying on the keys sitting on the
  server. Thus if multiple users will have access to the server, it is a good
  practice to not permit agent forwarding.

- **`X11Forwarding no`**: The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the
  client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client
  requests forwarding.

- **`PermitEmptyPasswords no`**: Explicitly disallow remote login from accounts
  with empty passwords.

Use the `-t` option to check the validity of the configuration file. If there
is an error, it will show on screen. Otherwise, it will not display any
message:

```shell
# sshd -t
```    

If no (error) message is displayed, restart the `sshd` process:

```shell
# service sshd restart
``` 

You will be able now to access to establish an SSH connection to the server
with `senaite` user, but using port `3022` instead:

```shell
me@local:~$ ssh -p3022 senaite@host

senaite@Debian-bullseye-64-minimal:~$
```

> **Warning**
> Note that remote access with `root` is no longer permitted depending on the
> value set for `PermitRootLogn` setting (see sshd configuration above).

## Modify server's hostname

During the installation of the minimal server you are asked to set a hostname.
You may have either skipped that step, or you've realized the hostname you've
set won't work. For instance, with the SSH sessions we've done in the previous
section, we can see the hostname is `Debian-bullseye-64-minimal`. This hostname
does not resemble to what the server will be used for. You can change the
hostname to e.g. `senaite-qsystem`, `senaite-psystem`, etc. as follows:

```shell
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname senaite-qsystem
$ hostname
senaite-qsystem
``` 

Open the file `/etc/hosts` and replace the old hostname by the new one:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

There is no need to reboot the server. If you open a new SSH connection, the
command prompt displays the new hostname:

```shell
me@local:~$ ssh -p3022 senaite@host
Linux senaite-qsystem 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12) x86_64

Last login: Sat Jun 10 22:35:16 2023 from 197.155.238.158
senaite@senaite-qsystem:~$
```

## Setup ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)

[ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)][ufw] is a program for managing a netfilter
firewall designed to be easy to use. For this server we only want the following
ports to be open:

- 80: Default port for http connections
- 443: Default port for Https connections
- 3022: The SSH port we configured earlier for SSH connections

Install ufw with the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install ufw
```

Set the open ports as follows:

```shell
$ sudo ufw allow 80
$ sudo ufw allow 443
$ sudo ufw allow 3022
``` 

And enable the firewall afterwards:

```shell
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 3022                       ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 80                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 3] 443                        ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 4] 3022 (v6)                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 5] 80 (v6)                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 6] 443 (v6)                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

## Add custom ssh motd login message

By-default most Linux/Unix machine has an `/etc/motd` file that contains text
message that will be printed when anyone login on the machine. You can
optionally modify this message by editing `/etc/motd` file as follows:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/motd
```

```
************************************************************************
WARNING: Unauthorized access to this system is forbidden and will be
prosecuted by law. By accessing this system, you agree that your actions
may be monitored if unauthorized usage is suspected.
************************************************************************
```

## Display OS version and code name in login message

The message that is actually printed on login is `/vat/run/mot.dynamic`. This
file is updated by `/etc/init.d/motd` at every boot. It is also updated by PAM
by running the scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d/`, if they exist. Add the
following file if it does not exist yet:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/update-motd.d/20-lsb-release
```

with these contents:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
lsb_release -ds
```

Give it exec privileges afterwards:

```shell
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/20-lsb-release
```

With this change, the system will display the operating system's description,
along with current version and codename.

## Setup logrotate for mail

System processes (e.g. cron) will keep sending emails to the local mail
account. Unless you setup a mail server [Postfix][postfix] and forward the
emails to an external email account, the system's mail files will keep growing.
To prevent disk space shortage, it is recommended to enable
[`logrotate`][logrotate] to rotate the files from `/var/mail`. Edit the
configuration file `/etc/logrotate.d/mail` as follows:

```ini
/var/mail/* {
    # Rotate if the size is >=10MB:
    size 10M

    # Keep 5 rotated logs
    rotate 5

    # Do not rotate if empty
    notifempty

    # Compresses rotated logs
    compress
}
```

## Add authorized RSA keys

To allow users to SSH into this server or into SENAITE instances from within
the same network through this server, you need to add their public RSA keys to
the authorized keys file:

```shell
$ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```
# Jordi PuiggenÃ© (Naralabs)

```

## Install fail2ban

[Fail2ban][fail2ban] is an internet security utility tool for Linux server and
web-host admins. You can use the Fail2ban tool to control, monitor, and add
rules on your Linux server.

```shell
$ sudo apt install fail2ban
```

Create a jail.local file and enable your own jails:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

```ini
[DEFAULT]
# "ignoreip" can be a list of IP addresses, CIDR masks or DNS hosts. Fail2ban
# will not ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses
# can be defined using space (and/or comma) separator.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1

# Number of seconds that a host is banned.
bantime  = 10m

# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
findtime  = 10m

# Number of failures before a host get banned.
maxretry = 5

[sshd]
# To use more aggressive sshd modes set filter parameter "mode" in jail.local:
# normal (default), ddos, extra or aggressive (combines all).
# See "tests/files/logs/sshd" or "filter.d/sshd.conf" for usage example.
mode    = normal
enabled = true
port    = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s
```

Start fail2ban service:

```shell
$ sudo service fail2ban start
```

You can now monitor the Fail2ban work functions from your Linux system:

```shell
$ sudo fail2ban-client status
$ sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

To add the Fail2ban package on your startup application list, use the following
system control command-line on your Linux terminal:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

### Fail2ban jail for badbots

If the server has to be reachable over internet, is also strongly recommended
to setup fail2ban to automatically ban bad bots. For this, create a filter
first as follows:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-badbots.conf
```

```ini
[Definition]

# Add the bot names to ban in this regex expression
badbots = %badbots%

failregex = (?i)<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD) (.*?)" \d+ \d+ "(.*?)" ".*(?:%(badbots)s).*"$

ignoreregex =
```

Replace `%badbots%` with the output from this command:

```shell
$ wget -q -O- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/_generator_lists/bad-user-agents.list" | sed -E 's/\\ / /g' | sed -E 's/([.:|()+/])/\\\1/g' | tr '\n' '|' | sed -E 's/\|$//g'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Updated list of bad bots can be found here:
> https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/_generator_lists/bad-user-agents.list
> You can create a cron script to automatically update the badbots file at
> regular intervals of time (e.g. once a week).

Add a jail in your fail2ban local file:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

```ini
[nginx-badbots]
enabled  = true
port     = http,https
filter   = nginx-badbots
logpath  = %(nginx_access_log)s
maxretry = 1
bantime  = 10d
```

> [!WARNING]
> Enable this jail only after you installed nginx. Fail2Ban will fail to
> start otherwise, cause no ``/var/log/nginx/*access.log`` is available
> yet.

Restart fail2ban:

```shell
$ sudo service fail2ban restart
```

### Auto-update list of badbots for Fail2ban

Create the `nginx-badbots.conf.template`

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-badbots.conf.template
```

```ini
[Definition]

# Add the bot names to ban in this regex expression
badbots = %badbots%

failregex = (?i)<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD) (.*?)" \d+ \d+ "(.*?)" ".*(?:%(badbots)s).*"$

ignoreregex =
```

Create a cron entry as follows:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/cron.d/nginx-badbots
```

```ini
# Update badbots every month
0 0 1 * * wget -q -O- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/_generator_lists/bad-user-agents.list" | sed -E 's/\\ / /g' | sed -E 's/([.:|()+/])/\\\1/g' | tr '\n' '|' | sed -E 's/\|$//g' > /tmp/badbots.txt && awk 'BEGIN{getline l < "/tmp/badbots.txt"}/%badbots%/{gsub("%badbots%",l)}1' /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-badbots.conf.template >/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-badbots.conf && service fail2ban restart
```

### Fail2ban jail for WP

[Wordpress][wordpress] is the most widely used CMS and as a result, there are
plenty of bots out there that try to login through http/https. We can block all
requests against common WS pages with the following jail. This is useful, even
if we do not install Wordpress, cause this will reduce the hits to our server
significantly:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wordpress.conf
```

```ini
[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST> .* "POST .*wp-login.php
            ^<HOST> .* "POST .*xmlrpc.php
ignoreregex =
```

Add a jail in your fail2ban local file:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

```ini
[wordpress]
enabled  = true
port     = http,https
filter   = wordpress
logpath  = %(nginx_access_log)s
# Ban if 5 attempts in less than 15 minutes
findtime = 15m
maxretry = 5
bantime  = 5d
```

> [!WARNING]
> Enable this jail only after you installed nginx. Fail2Ban will fail to
> start otherwise, cause no ``/var/log/nginx/*access.log`` is available
> yet.

Restart fail2ban:

```shell
$ sudo service fail2ban restart
```

## Configure static IP

First, identify the ethernet interface on which we will configure static IP
address:

```shell
$ ip -c link show
```

Note down the Debian Linux interface name (eg. `ens192`) and type the following
ip command to see the current IP address assigned to that network interface:

```shell
$ ip -c addr show ens192
```

The `/etc/network/interfaces` file contains network interface configuration
information for Debian Linux. Hence, edit the file, and properly configure the
interface you identified above. The section for the configuration of the
interface with an static IP should look similar to:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

```ini
# The primary network interface
auto ens192
iface ens192 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
```

Reboot for the changes to take effect:

```shell
$ sudo reboot -h now
```
